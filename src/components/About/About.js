      Hello There, I am Tim Adamczyk. Welcome to my Website. This is a starting point for what
      I hope to be a larger repository of images and explainations of my work in Web Development, 
      as well as explainations as to why i am interested in spending inordinate ammounts of time 
      looking at the computer in the attempt to understand web development and software development at large. 
    </p>
    <p class="lh-copy measure"> 
    I Sincerly hope that this website is not only a deep dive into the concepts that interest me but also provide 
    a respit from the day to day functionality of some of the web development software that we use. Hacking , for example, 
    is not as much as breaking as it is a discovery through compartmentalization is it a deep dive while seeking another perspective. 
    I hope this website to show my thinking that web devleopment is a tapesry of tools to use for the greater purpose of meaning building.
